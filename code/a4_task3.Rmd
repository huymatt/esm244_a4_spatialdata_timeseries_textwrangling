For the purpose of this text analysis, I will use one of my favorite novels, *The Kite Runner.*  Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini's first novel is a coming-of-age story following the maturation of Amir, an Afghan male, through Afghanistan's tumultuous recent history. It showcases life in Afghanistan prior to the soviet invasion, under soviet occupation, under Taliban rule, and under U.S. occupation. Inspired by Hosseini's own experiences and family heritage, the novel explores themes such as class division, betrayal, religion, growing up, and similarities and differences between American and Afghan culture. For someone such as myself who knew very little about Afghanistan prior to reading the novel, *The Kite Runner.* shed light on the rich culture and people of a country that is often reduced down to its leaders (the Taliban), and associated terrorist groups. \

In this analysis, I will observe the frequency and sentiment of words used in each chapter and the novel overall.\

#### Analysis:
Looks like pretty negative sentiment throughout most of the novel. This makes sense given the setting in war-torn Afghanistan.

```{r}
kr_nrc <- kr_wordcounts %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

kr_nrc_counts <- kr_nrc %>% 
  count(chapter, sentiment) %>% 
  filter(chapter %in% c("Two", "Five", "Eight", "Eleven", "Fourteen", "Eighteen", "Twenty-two", "Twenty-five")) 

ggplot(data = kr_nrc_counts, 
       aes(x = n, 
           y = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(fill = "slategray3") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 6),             #x axis breaks
                     limits = c(0, 180),                             #x axis range
                     expand = c(0,0)) +
  facet_wrap(~chapter) +
  labs(x = "wordcount",
       caption = "Figure 4: Sentiment of words in each various chapters of The Kite RUnner.") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black", size = 10),                   
        axis.title.x = element_text(color = "black", size = 10, face = "bold"),  
        axis.title.y = element_text(color = "black", size = 10, face = "bold",
                                    vjust = 2),           
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, color = "black",
                                    size = 10, face = "bold"))
